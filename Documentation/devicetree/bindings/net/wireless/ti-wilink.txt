TI WiLink Wireless Modules Device Tree Bindings
===============================================

The WiLink modules provide wireless connectivity, such as WLAN,
Bluetooth, FM and NFC.

There are several different modules available, which can be grouped by
their generation: WiLink6, WiLink7 and WiLink8.  WiLink4 is not
currently supported with device tree.

Currently, only the WLAN portion of the modules is supported with
device tree.

Required properties:
--------------------

- compatible: should be "ti,wilink6", "ti,wilink7" or "ti,wilink8"
- interrupt-parent: the interrupt controller
- interrupts: out-of-band WLAN interrupt
	See the interrupt controller's bindings documentation for
	detailed definition.

Optional properties:
--------------------

- refclock: the internal WLAN reference clock frequency (required for
  WiLink6 and WiLink7; not used for WiLink8).  Must be one of the
  following:
	0 = 19.2 MHz
	1 = 26.0 MHz
	2 = 38.4 MHz
	3 = 52.0 MHz
	4 = 38.4 MHz, XTAL
	5 = 26.0 MHz, XTAL

- tcxoclock: the internal WLAN TCXO clock frequency (required for
  WiLink7 not used for WiLink6 and WiLink8).  Must be one of the
  following:
	0 = 19.200 MHz
	1 = 26.000 MHz
	2 = 38.400 MHz
	3 = 52.000 MHz
	4 = 16.368 MHz
	5 = 32.736 MHz
	6 = 16.800 MHz
	7 = 33.600 MHz

National Instruments CPLD

National Instruments (NI) boards often have CPLDs on them to handle
board-specific tasks like LED control, board switches and buttons,
power sequencing, and CPU-independent watchdogs.

NI's CPLDs are connected over i2c. As such, 'nicpld' must be a child
of an i2c node.

nicpld properties:
- compatible : (required)
  Should be "ni,cpld"
- reg: (required)
  Address of the CPLD on the i2c bus

Required sub-nodes:
- watchdogs : A node containing sub-nodes describing watchdogs

Optional sub-nodes:
- switches : A node containing sub-nodes describing switches
- leds : A node containing sub-nodes describing LEDs


Watchdogs Child Node
====================

Each watchdog controlled by the CPLD is represented as a sub-node of
the nicpld's 'watchdogs' node. Each sub-node of 'watchdogs' has the
following properties.

Required properties:
- interrupts : Should be the CPLD watchdog interrupt specifier

Optional properties:
- label: A name for the CPLD switch


Switches Child Node
===================

Each switch or button controlled by the CPLD is represented as a
sub-node of the nicpld's 'switches' node. Each sub-node of 'switches'
has the following properties.

Required properties:
- interrupts : The CPLD switch interrupt specifier


LEDs Child Node
===============

Each LED controlled by the CPLD is represented as a sub-node of the
nicpld's 'leds' node.  The name of each LED node corresponds to an
LED type. The "-0" or "-1" suffixes specify an LED element (single
color) within a multi-color LED.

Possible LED types:
- user1-0
- user1-1
- status-0
- status-1
- temp-alert-0
- wifi-0
- wifi-1
- eth0-0
- eth0-1
- eth1-0
- eth1-1

Different CPLDs support different LED types. The set of LEDs that
various CPLDs support can be determined by examining their product
code. The product code for a CPLD can be determined by reading the
"NICPLD_PRODUCT" (0x1D) register of the CPLD over i2c. Below is a
list of which CPLDs support which LED types.

CPLD Products 0x00 and 0x01
---------------------------
user1-0
user1-1

eth1-1


LED sub-node properties:
- label :  (optional)
  see bindings/leds/common.txt
- max-brightness : (optional)
  The number of possible special blinking patterns. Selecting a
  brightness will pick the blink pattern.
- linux,default-trigger :  (optional)
  see bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

nicpld@40 {
	compatible = "ni,cpld";
	reg = <0x40>;

	watchdogs {
		boot-watchdog {
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
			interrupts = <24 0>;
		};
	};

	switches {
		wifi-switch {
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
			interrupts = <25 0>;
		};
	};

	leds {
		user1-0 {
			label = "nilrt:user1:green";
		};
		status-0 {
			label = "nilrt:status:yellow";
			max-brightness = <0xFFFF>;
		};
		eth0-0 {
			label = "nilrt:eth0:green";
			linux,default-trigger =
				"e000b000.etherne:00:100Mb";
		};
		eth0-1 {
			label = "nilrt:eth0:yellow";
			linux,default-trigger =
				"e000b000.etherne:00:Gb";
		};
	};
};

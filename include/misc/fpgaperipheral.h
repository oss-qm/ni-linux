 * The value passed to notifier callbacks will be one of these.
 * FPGA_PERIPHERAL_DOWN: The FPGA is about to be unprogrammed.
 * FPGA_PERIPHERAL_UP: The FPGA is now programmed.
 *  This may be called even if not preceeded by an FPGA_PERIPHERAL_DOWN.
 * FPGA_PERIPHERAL_FAILED: The FPGA programming failed.
 *  If this is called, clients should not use the FPGA as it might be in
 *  a bad state. This is to notify the clients to abort any waiting for
 *  the FPGA to come back up.
 *
 * Client callbacks should always return notifier_from_errno(0) so the
 * call chain continues to all clients.
